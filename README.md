# Aloha Project

Hi there, this is my first web project. It's been a whirlwind getting to this final (for now) product, which makes use of HTML, CSS, and rudimentary JavaScript. The following are some of the 

## Key Things I learned:

* _margin: 0 auto;_ is my best friend, even if I don't yet understand why it always seems to work
* Understanding specificity is critical to understanding CSS. When a CSS property doesn't work like you expected it to, it's important to refer back to HTML to pinpoint the level at which I want to be giving instructions
* Even though it's often infuriating, Inspect is my other best friend; it'll always tell me the answer I need, as long as if I'm asking questions about the right elements (much like the internet)
* there is still so much more I need to learn, but the good thing is that as long as I half remember what things are called, there's very little that I can't look up.
